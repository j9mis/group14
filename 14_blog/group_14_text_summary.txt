Group 14 Summary of Final Project

This project centered on the exploration of data involving the details of the police killings experienced in the United States in the year 2015. The data was gathered from three separate sources, The Guardian, FiveThirtyEight, and Buzzfeed News. With all of these sources, we were able to compile a complete listing of all individuals killed in 2015 by the police, and the details surrounding the event. We supplemented our data with various pieces of demographic information regarding the area in which the incident took place. This includes the median income, the racial makeup, and the educational attainment of the area was. This was done by taking the latitude and longitude of the incident, using the National Broadband Map Census API to gather the census tract of the location, and then using the US census API to collect the data. We then performed exploratory analysis to find interesting characteristics of the data. Using what we found in our exploratory phase, we created a Shiny application that was able to allow the user to create some of the more interesting plots that we found from the analysis. We also gave the Shiny application the ability to put the location of every incident of a police killing on a US map, where each point on the map designates the location of the death. Users can click on the points on the map to explore information about each incident, as well as filter the points on the map by certain criteria, such as whether the individual was armed, whether they were in the racial majority, or what their area's high school graduation rate was.
